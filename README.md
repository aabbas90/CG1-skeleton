# Recursive-Ray-Tracer
Implementation of a Ray-Tracer for Rendering in C++ carried out for the course of Computer Graphics at Saarland University taught by [Prof. Philipp Slusallek](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/people/slusallek.html).
The goal of the project was to implement Ray-Tracing without using any Rendering Library for a developing a deeper understanding of
Rendering concepts.
## Example Output:
